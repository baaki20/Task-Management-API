# Spring Framework, IoC, and Spring Boot Overview

## 1. Spring Framework

Spring Framework is a comprehensive, modular platform for building Java applications. It provides infrastructure support for developing robust, maintainable, and scalable enterprise applications. Key features include:

- **Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC)**
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Data Access (JDBC, ORM, Transactions)
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) web framework
- Integration with various technologies (JMS, JMX, etc.)

Spring promotes loose coupling and testability by managing application components and their dependencies.

## 2. Inversion of Control (IoC)

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the application code to a container or framework.

- In Spring, the **IoC Container** is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling beans (objects).
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is the most common IoC implementation in Spring, where dependencies are injected into objects via constructors, setters, or fields.

**Benefits:**
- Decouples application components
- Improves testability and maintainability
- Centralizes configuration

**Example:**
```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```
Here, `UserRepository` is injected into `UserService` by the Spring IoC container.

## 3. Spring Boot

**Spring Boot** is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Auto-configuration:** Automatically configures Spring and third-party libraries based on project dependencies.
- **Standalone:** Creates executable JARs with embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).
- **Opinionated Defaults:** Provides sensible defaults to reduce boilerplate configuration.
- **Production-ready:** Includes features like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration.

**Typical Spring Boot Application:**
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class TaskManagementApiApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(TaskManagementApiApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**Advantages:**
- Rapid application development
- Minimal configuration
- Easy integration with Spring ecosystem
